# Salon Booking System - Backend Management

**URL** Link: https://sevenwebs-assignment.onrender.com/  Backend is deployed in this link.

I have used Tech stack of  1. Nodejs
                           2. Expressjs
                           3. MongoDB database

- In this, I have implemented the features of **Authentication system for Users**, **Availability of Slots**, which will be updated by Salon Owner and **Booking of Slots** by Users.
  
- In **models** folder, I have written schemas of different features(model preparation), and in **middleware** folder, I have written middleware for validation, and in **controllers** folder, I have written the main code for CRUD operations for different features.

- For clear details about the project, I have mentioned each and everything in my report: **Assignment-Report-Bhargav.pdf**, which I have attached above along with the files.
